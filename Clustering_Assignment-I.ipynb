    "K-Means is an iterative partitioning algorithm for clustering data. It aims to divide a dataset into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize: Choose K initial cluster centroids randomly.\n",
    "2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "3. Update: Recalculate the centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (no or minimal change in assignments).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm seeks to minimize the sum of squared distances (inertia) between data points and their assigned cluster centroids. K-Means is sensitive to the initial centroid selection, so it may require multiple runs with different initializations to find the best clustering."

    "1. **Elbow Method:** Plot the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) against the number of clusters. The \"elbow\" point, where the rate of decrease sharply changes, is a good estimate for K.\n",

    "2. **Silhouette Score:** Calculate the average silhouette score for different values of K. A higher silhouette score indicates better cluster separation, helping to choose the optimal K.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Silhouette Analysis:** For each data point, compute its silhouette coefficient, which quantifies how similar it is to its own cluster compared to others. The overall average silhouette score can help determine the optimal K.\n",

    "6. **Calinski-Harabasz Index (Variance Ratio Criterion):** It measures the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. Higher values suggest better cluster separation.\n",
