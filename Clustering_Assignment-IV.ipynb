Increasing the number of clusters tends to reduce the DB Index, making it favor solutions with more clusters. This can be a limitation when selecting the optimal number of clusters.\n",

    "Keep in mind that the Silhouette Coefficient is more suitable for hierarchical clustering solutions with clearly defined and well-separated clusters. If the hierarchical clustering algorithm produces results with overlapping or irregularly shaped clusters, the Silhouette Coefficient may not provide a comprehensive assessment. In such cases, consider using other evaluation metrics that are better suited to the specific characteristics of the data and clustering problem.\n",
