You can assess this assumption by examining ACF and PACF plots of the residuals and running tests like the Ljung-Box test.\n",

    "Complexity: If the data is relatively simple, a basic ARIMA model might suffice. For more complex patterns, you may need a more sophisticated model.\n",

    "Data Volume: The amount of data available can also influence the choice. More data can support more complex models.\n",

However, starting with a Seasonal ARIMA or a simpler ARIMA model is a reasonable choice for monthly sales data with the potential for seasonality.
