    "To create a Bokeh plot using Python code, you'll need to install the Bokeh library and import the necessary modules. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Bokeh: Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pip install bokeh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the required modules: In your Python script, import the necessary modules from the Bokeh library. The most commonly used modules are `bokeh.plotting` for creating plots and `bokeh.io` for displaying them. You can also import other modules based on your specific needs.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "   from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set up the plot: Initialize a `figure` object, which will serve as the canvas for your plot. You can specify various attributes like the plot size, title, axis labels, etc.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot = figure(title='My Bokeh Plot', x_axis_label='X-axis', y_axis_label='Y-axis', plot_width=600, plot_height=400)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add data to the plot: Use the `plot` object to add data points or other graphical elements to the plot. Bokeh provides various glyph methods like `circle()`, `line()`, `rect()`, etc., to represent different types of data.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot.circle(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=10, color='blue')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Display the plot: After adding all the necessary elements to the plot, you can display it using the `show()` function. This will open the plot in a new browser window or notebook cell, depending on your environment.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   output_notebook()  # If you are using a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab\n",
    "   show(plot)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can create a basic Bokeh plot using Python code. You can further customize your plot by exploring the extensive options provided by the Bokeh library, such as adding legends, tooltips, hover effects, and interactivity."

    "In Bokeh, glyphs are the visual representations of data on a plot. They can be used to display various types of geometric shapes such as circles, lines, rectangles, triangles, and more. Glyphs are added to a Bokeh plot using the glyph methods provided by the `bokeh.plotting` module. Each glyph method corresponds to a specific shape or type of visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to add glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set up the plot\n",
    "plot = figure(title='My Bokeh Plot', x_axis_label='X-axis', y_axis_label='Y-axis', plot_width=600, plot_height=400)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add glyphs to the plot\n",
    "plot.circle(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=10, color='blue')\n",
    "plot.line(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[6, 7, 2, 4, 5], line_width=2, color='red')\n",
    "plot.triangle(x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=[6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=10, color='green')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a scatter plot with circles, a line plot, and a scatter plot with triangles. The `circle()` method is used to add circles as glyphs to represent the data points. The `line()` method is used to add a line glyph, and the `triangle()` method is used to add triangle glyphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each glyph method accepts various parameters to customize the appearance of the glyphs. In the example above, `x` and `y` specify the coordinates of the data points, `size` determines the size of the glyphs, and `color` sets the color of the glyphs. These parameters can be adjusted to match the specific requirements of your data and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use `output_notebook()` to enable notebook output if you are using a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and `show(plot)` to display the plot in a new browser window or notebook cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining different glyph methods and their respective parameters, you can create diverse and visually appealing visualizations in Bokeh."

    "Bokeh provides various options for customizing the appearance of a plot, including axes, title, and legend. Here's a guide on how to customize these elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customizing Axes:\n",
    "   - To customize the x-axis or y-axis labels, you can use the `x_axis_label` and `y_axis_label` attributes of the `figure` object.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot = figure(x_axis_label='X-axis Label', y_axis_label='Y-axis Label')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You can modify the tick labels and formatting using the `xaxis` and `yaxis` attributes of the `figure` object.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot.xaxis.axis_label_text_font_style = \"italic\"\n",
    "   plot.yaxis.major_label_text_color = \"red\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To control the range and scaling of the axes, you can adjust the `x_range` and `y_range` attributes.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot.x_range = Range1d(0, 10)  # Set x-axis range from 0 to 10\n",
    "   plot.y_range = DataRange1d(start=0)  # Set y-axis range starting from 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Customizing Title:\n",
    "   - To set the plot title, you can use the `title` attribute of the `figure` object.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot = figure(title='My Bokeh Plot')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You can modify the appearance of the title text using various attributes like `text_font`, `text_font_style`, `text_font_size`, etc.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot.title.text_font = \"Arial\"\n",
    "   plot.title.text_font_style = \"bold\"\n",
    "   plot.title.text_font_size = \"16pt\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customizing Legend:\n",
    "   - To add a legend to your plot, you can pass the `legend_label` parameter when adding glyphs to the plot.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot.circle(x, y, legend_label='Data 1')\n",
    "   plot.line(x, y, legend_label='Data 2')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You can customize the position and appearance of the legend using the `legend` attribute of the `figure` object.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plot.legend.location = \"top_right\"  # Set the position of the legend\n",
    "   plot.legend.label_text_font = \"Times New Roman\"\n",
    "   plot.legend.label_text_font_style = \"italic\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of how you can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot. Bokeh provides a wide range of options to control colors, fonts, sizes, scales, and more. You can explore the documentation and experiment with different attributes to achieve the desired visual style for your plot."

    "The Bokeh server is a feature of the Bokeh library that allows you to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time. It enables you to build dynamic web applications with interactive visualizations powered by Bokeh.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Bokeh server, your Python code runs on a server and communicates with the client-side web browser via websockets. This allows for bidirectional communication, enabling the server to push updates to the plot in real time based on user interactions or other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Bokeh server and create interactive plots, you follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the plot and its initial state: Create a Bokeh plot as you normally would, setting up the data, glyphs, and any initial settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add interactive elements: Incorporate interactive elements into your plot, such as sliders, buttons, dropdowns, or other widgets. These elements will trigger events and update the plot in response to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define callback functions: Write Python functions that define how the plot should be updated when events are triggered. These functions will be executed on the server and can modify the plot data, glyphs, or other plot attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Bokeh application: Use the bokeh.application module to create a Bokeh application object, which encapsulates your plot and its associated callback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the Bokeh server: Run the Bokeh server from the command line using the bokeh serve command, specifying the Python script containing your Bokeh application. This starts the server and makes your interactive plot available in a web browser.\n",
